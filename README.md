Message Encoder and Decoder
We made a Program for message passing through the erasure and symmetric channels. It includes an information encoder at the transmitter side using Tanner Graph model. 
We then design spot checks according to a channel. For each channel received, binary code will be decoded using hard and soft-decision decoding methods.
